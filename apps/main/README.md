# drinks-app

This is a [sidebase merino](https://sidebase.io/) app created by running `pnpm create sidebase@latest`. This project uses the following technologies for a great developer- and user-experience:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind CSS

## How to get going?

This is a straight-forward setup with minimal templating and scaffolding. The options you selected during the sidebase CLI setup are all here though. Good places to continue reading are:
- [the First Steps documentation](https://sidebase.io/sidebase/usage)
- [our discord](https://discord.gg/auc8eCeGzx)

Some tasks you should probably do in the beginning are:
- [ ] replace this generic README with a more specific one
- [ ] install the Vue Volar extension
- [ ] enable [Volar takeover mode](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites) to ensure a smooth editor setup
- [ ] Prisma: Edit your `prisma/prisma.schema` to your liking
- [ ] Prisma: Run `npx prisma db push` to sync the schema to your database after changing the schema
- [ ] Prisma: Run `npx prisma generate` to re-generate the client after changing the schema
